# DECODEDEV

**Cognitive injection for AI-augmented development.**

One file. Drag into any AI conversation. Instant capability upgrade.

## What Is This

`DECODEDEV-BOOT.md` is a boot document that enhances any AI's development capabilities. Paste it at the start of a conversation and the AI operates with:

- First-principles reasoning applied systematically
- Pattern recognition with explicit rationale
- Trade-off analysis as default behavior
- Meta-awareness of its own reasoning quality
- Problem reframing before problem solving

## Usage

1. Copy contents of `DECODEDEV-BOOT.md`
2. Paste at start of any AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)
3. Wait for verification response
4. Proceed with enhanced assistance

That's it.

## What Changes

**Before:** AI answers the question you asked with pattern-matched code.

**After:** AI decodes the actual problem, analyzes trade-offs, and builds solutions with verification approaches.
